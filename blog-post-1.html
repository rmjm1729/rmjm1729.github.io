        <h2>Whiplash: My take on Achieving Greatness</h2>
        <p>"For mastery, you need perfection. For perfection, you need repetition."</p>
        <p>Whiplash is the first entry in what I like to call The Chazelle Club , a group of films that orbit around obsession, purpose, and the lonely, soul-crushing pursuit of greatness through music, particularly jazz. Alongside La La Land and even Pixar‚Äôs Soul, it shares this spiritual DNA, characters who aren't just playing music, but meandering the path to meaning through it.</p>
        <p>Jazz, as I understand it, was born from chaos. From Black musicians without formal training, creating something powerful out of nothing. It wasn‚Äôt about rules. It was about rebellion. It was about being loud, flawed, alive. Fletcher, ironically, worships the opposite: control. Tempo. Discipline. Pain. But beneath his cruelty is a powerful belief, that the hardest diamonds are forged under the strongest pressures. He doesn‚Äôt just want the music to be perfect. He wants the man to suffer, crack, and be reborn, find new meaning through the journey. It's almost as if the caterpillar is given a harder cocoon so that the wings of the butterfly are Harder Better Faster Stronger.</p>
        <p>And Neimann? He‚Äôs the guy. He is us. The guy with the dream no one takes seriously. The guy who drowns in practice while others eat dinner. He wants to matter. Not be good. Be great. He doesn‚Äôt want applause. He wants to bleed art. I get that. Deeply.</p>
        <p>So to anyone who thinks this isn‚Äôt one of modern cinema‚Äôs finest,
<b><blockquote> are not in my fucking tempo.</blockquote></p>
